# ⚡ Field Investigations

Welcome to **Field Investigations** — a curated repository of field notes, technical case studies, and engineering insights gathered from real-world projects throughout my career as a Power Engineer. This archive serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others in the electrical engineering community who are navigating similar challenges in power systems, protection schemes, and utility-scale design.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository documents lessons learned and technical references from hands-on field investigations, including:

- **Load Flow Studies** — Practical observations and modeling tips from industrial, commercial, and utility power systems.
- **Protection Schemes** — Notes and sketches from field audits, coordination studies, and relay grading exercises.
- **Power Quality & Fault Analysis** — Case studies involving harmonics, transients, and abnormal operating conditions.
- **Arc Flash & Safety Practices** — On-site mitigation techniques and applied standards (IEEE 1584, NFPA 70E, etc).
-  **Photos, Logs & Diagrams** — Annotated images, system one-lines, and substation walkdowns.
- **Electrical Design** - Electrical Design Field Notes and Templates
