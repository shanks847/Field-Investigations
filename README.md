# ⚡ Field Investigations

Welcome to **Field Investigations** — a curated repository of field notes, technical case studies, and engineering insights gathered from real-world projects throughout my career as a Power Engineer. This archive serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others in the electrical engineering community who are navigating similar challenges in power systems, protection schemes, and utility-scale design.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository documents lessons learned and technical references from hands-on field investigations, including:

- **Load Flow Studies** — Practical observations and modeling tips from industrial, commercial, and utility power systems.
- **Protection Schemes** — Notes and sketches from field audits, coordination studies, and relay grading exercises.
- **Power Quality & Fault Analysis** — Case studies involving harmonics, transients, and abnormal operating conditions.
- **Arc Flash & Safety Practices** — On-site mitigation techniques and applied standards (IEEE 1584, NFPA 70E, etc).

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

- Power Systems Engineers looking for real-life applications of design tools and field practices.
- Junior engineers learning the bridge between simulation and what happens on site.
- Industry practitioners seeking tested ideas for system planning, commissioning, or maintenance strategies.
